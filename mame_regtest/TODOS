		- multithreading mode
		- configuration rewrite
			- empty options will not properly overwrite/reset existing options to default values

			- use folder node in-between to be able to switch folders
		- test absolute paths in INI (debugfile / rompath)
		- run test_createconfig in dummy_root to avoid usage of existing mame.ini

			- gtime <milliseconds in hex>
			- hardreset (causes endless restarts of MAME)

			- list*
			- test frontend functions (-listfull etc.)
			- call -validate?
			- call "-listdevices" for MESS?

	internal:
		- call parse_directory() in execute_mame() / call clear_directory() in execute_mame2()
		- make pointers const (or const * const)
		- move MNG frame parsing into seperate function
		- change strcpy() to strncpy()
		- change strcat() to strncat()
		- add printf-format support to append_string()
		- better way to align the dummy_root INI lines
		- use functions for lists
			- list_create()
			- list_next_entry()
			- list_insert() - sorted
			- list_append() - unsorted
			- list_free()
		- rename CFG_STR_PTR to CFG_STR
		- handle all options as string (use atoi() to convert to integers)
		- factor out duplicated PNG/MNG code
		- create open_mng_and_skip_sig() for PNG
		- get MEND reference out of IDAT function
		- change ram, bioses and devices from arrays to lists

	issues/bugs/errorhandling:
		- avoid duplicated slashes
		- properly handle invalid XPath expressions (check for DRIVER_ROOT / react on libxml2 errors)
		- bail out when invalid config type found
		- test chdir() on start-up and bail out when it fails
		- valgrind variables mix libc and libxml2 allocations
		- config_gamelist_xml_file mixes libc and libxml2 allocations

	documentation:
		- wiki
			- the different builds
			- how the results are created
			- the machine the tests are run on
			- the resulting command-line
			- a run on the official binary once the cycle is completed
			- runs with the usual builds on the u-releases
			- add MAME version to hack_mngwrite description (change seems to be in 0.108u5)
			- add notes about dependencies between options in the documentation
			- add note to "use_debug" about needing a build with USE_DEBUGGER=1 and about the version, that started to include the debugger in non-debug builds
			- update building instructions in Wiki
		- update URLs from toseciso.org to redump.net
		- update old webpage with latest version and new links

	compilation:
		- fix compilation on systems, that already have a htonl() function
		- change LITTLE_ENDIAN/BIG_ENDIAN defines - they are both defined on some systems (maybe BYTE_ORDER? LSB_FIRST?)
		- fix Fedora Core 10 compilation (MAX_PATH)
		- make doesn't work when the additional files already exist and you compile by target (e.g. mame_regtest.exe)
		- switch to binaries/includes from http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/

	create_report:
		- write comparison tool
			- parse dir A and check dir B for missing file
			- parse dir B and check dir A for new files
			- show the following
				- files differ (PNG/MNG frame diffs)
				- exitcode differs
				- files missing
				- new files
				- stdout/stderr differs
		- add documentation for configuration
		- HTML report
			- create HTML report (different variants)
				Unexpected Returnvalues (sourcefile - driver - returncode - details [flags, stdout])
				Untested Games (sourcefile - driver)
				Image Comparison results (sourcefile - driver / with images links - before and after)
				All Result Images
			- add paging to HTML report (by letters / x entries per page)
			- add all messages to HTML report
			- add all options to HTML report
			- put HTML report into a folder and copy pictures in a <html_report_name>_new/<html_report_name>_ref folder
			- add option for main HTML report folder
			- make HTML report work in Mozilla ( use /ref and /new links)
		- extract differing frames (also for HTML report)
		- show PNG differences (use Aaron's code)
		- color codes based on exitcodes
		- expose the data (collect the necessary XMLs and add them to a subfolder?)
		- wiki syntax
			| row1 | row 2 |
		- create an intermediate format to process, so it's not necessary to process all output again when a new version comes out
			- add option to merge the output to a report
		- properly handle sets with autosave (use index in XPath to access the second set of nodes when both support autosave)
		- handle missing attributes properly
		- add the various XPaths as options in the configuration
		- create default configuration for create_report to match removed options
			- result_file
			- add some useful reports from old create_report
		- use proper formating for "(autosave)" string
		- use grep to diff each file
			- regex for auto.sta "^[+-].*auto.sta"
		- check for "cheat expression" errors in stderr

	Linux:
		- add a signal handler for linux?

	Known Issues:
		- not everything is properly encoded by xmlEncodeEntitiesReentrant()
		- using autosave will overwrite the initial valgrind log-file for the driver (well..not really, it adds the pid - still you want to differ them easily)

	Test TODOs:
		- test release and debug builds of MAME and MESS
		- test 32-bit compile on 64-bit OS (windows and linux)
		- test 64-bit compile
		- test with SDLMAME/SDLMESS
		- test on PPC
		- create testset with images for each device in each driver

	Misc:
		- create patch to write show_ui() in a file
		- MAME patches
			- add "exit"/"run-and-hide" command to debugger
