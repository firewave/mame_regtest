		- make it possible to set affinity of a run (SetProcessAffinityMask() / sched_setaffinity())
		- make dipswitches/configurations work with ramsizes and bioses
		- add signal/abort handler and cleanup in it
		- do not check the default ramsize again in bios/ram combination runs
		- take a look at messtest for "hardreset" tests and extended image testing
		- "device_mandatory" doesn't specify which device is the mandatory one
		- "start_at" sample actually starts after the specified set
		- image testing
			- attribute to disable an image entry in the XML
			- add base folder for images in XML (could also be used for parsing a folder?)

				- add parse flag?
				- only use on relative path entries (x:\, /, \\, etc.)

	issues/bugs/errorhandling:
		- avoid duplicated slashes
		- properly handle invalid XPath expressions (check for DRIVER_ROOT)

			- update building instructions in Wiki
			- verify the version number for software lists
		- document upper limit of dipswitches/devices/etc. of 100000		

	compilation:
		- fix compilation on systems, that already have a htonl() function
		- change LITTLE_ENDIAN/BIG_ENDIAN defines - they are both defined on some systems (maybe BYTE_ORDER? LSB_FIRST?)
		- fix Fedora Core 10 compilation (MAX_PATH)
		- make doesn't work when the additional files already exist and you compile by target (e.g. mame_regtest.exe)
		- switch to binaries/includes from http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/
		- create working x64 version
		
	Visual Studio:
		- move the Microsoft-specific defines into a seperate header
		- get proper libxml2 DLL to get Visual Studio working
		
	create_report:
		- write comparison tool
			- parse dir A and check dir B for missing file
			- parse dir B and check dir A for new files
			- show the following
				- files differ (PNG/MNG frame diffs)
				- exitcode differs
				- files missing
				- new files
				- stdout/stderr differs
		- add documentation for configuration
		- HTML report
			- create HTML report (different variants)
				Unexpected Returnvalues (sourcefile - driver - returncode - details [flags, stdout])
				Untested Games (sourcefile - driver)
				Image Comparison results (sourcefile - driver / with images links - before and after)
				All Result Images
			- add paging to HTML report (by letters / x entries per page)
			- add all messages to HTML report
			- add all options to HTML report
			- put HTML report into a folder and copy pictures in a <html_report_name>_new/<html_report_name>_ref folder
			- add option for main HTML report folder
			- make HTML report work in Mozilla ( use /ref and /new links)
		- extract differing frames (also for HTML report)
		- show PNG differences (use pngcmp)
		- color codes based on exitcodes
		- expose the data (collect the necessary XMLs and add them to a subfolder?)
		- wiki syntax
			| row1 | row 2 |
		- create an intermediate format to process, so it's not necessary to process all output again when a new version comes out
			- add option to merge the output to a report
		- properly handle sets with autosave (use index in XPath to access the second set of nodes when both support autosave)
		- handle missing attributes properly
		- add the various XPaths as options in the configuration
		- create default configuration for create_report to match removed options
			- result_file
			- add some useful reports from old create_report
		- use proper formating for "(autosave)" string
		- use grep to diff each file
			- regex for auto.sta "^[+-].*auto.sta"
		- check for "cheat expression" errors in stderr
		- add check for a specific string as option 
			- replace "called within reset scope by" with it -> field="stderr" string="called within reset scope by"
			- allow multiple ones
		- support subfolders
		- skip support files (*_listsoftware.xml)
		- find out what the various negative erorcodes mean
		- replace hard-coded format with templates
			
	create_image_xml
		- add more output to create_image_xml
		
	pngcmp:
		- analyze where the most time is spent
		- try to optimize it, but comparing and writing in the same loop and just don't write the final bitmap when they differ
		- package optimized mingw binary instead of Visual Studio one

	Known Issues:
		- not everything is properly encoded by xmlEncodeEntitiesReentrant()
		- using autosave will overwrite the initial valgrind log-file for the driver (well..not really, it adds the pid - still you want to differ them easily)

	Test TODOs:
		- test release and debug builds of MAME and MESS
		- test 32-bit compile on 64-bit OS (windows and linux)
		- test 64-bit compile
		- test with SDLMAME/SDLMESS
		- test on PPC
		- create testset with images for each device in each driver
		- split up MAME test into #-z

	Misc:
		- create patch to write show_ui() in a file
		- MAME patches
			- add "exit"/"run-and-hide" command to debugger
