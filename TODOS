		- change LITTLE_ENDIAN/BIG_ENDIAN defines - they are both defined on some systems (maybe BYTE_ORDER? LSB_FIRST?)
		- make doesn't work when the additional files already exist and you compile by target (e.g. mame_regtest.exe)
		- create working x64 version
		
	Visual Studio:
		- move the Microsoft-specific defines into a seperate header
		
	create_report:
		- write comparison tool
			- parse dir A and check dir B for missing file
			- parse dir B and check dir A for new files

				- files differ (PNG/MNG frame diffs)
				- exitcode differs
				- files missing
				- new files
				- stdout/stderr differs
		- add documentation for configuration
		- HTML report
			- create HTML report (different variants)

		- show PNG differences (use pngcmp)
		- color codes based on exitcodes
		- expose the data (collect the necessary XMLs and add them to a subfolder?)
		- wiki syntax
			| row1 | row 2 |
		- create an intermediate format to process, so it's not necessary to process all output again when a new version comes out
			- add option to merge the output to a report
		- properly handle sets with autosave (use index in XPath to access the second set of nodes when both support autosave)
		- handle missing attributes properly
		- add the various XPaths as options in the configuration
		- create default configuration for create_report to match removed options
			- result_file
			- add some useful reports from old create_report
		- use proper formating for "(autosave)" string

		- replace hard-coded format with templates
		- use tables in comparison report?
		- create output_folder
			- same behavior as mame_regtest output folder
		- convert \n to <br> in stdout and stderr output
		- how to support multiples paths for comparison reports?
		- try to detect new/missing sets in comparison separately
		- note differences about bios or ramsize etc. in results
		- when merged configuration exists in results folder add information to report
		- comparison doesn't crate output folder - doesn't complain when it's missing either
		- add optional to list OPTIONAL warnings
		- add option to print negative exitcodes in hex
		- add reports, that parse -log output for like "unmapped writes" and stuff
		- add HTML version of the error report
		- filter gdb output
			- stdout
				- "[New Thread"
				- "[Inferior"
			- stderr
				- "No stack."
		- in comparison report show which is which
		- parse the valgrind.log for
			- "uninit"
			- "Invalid"
			- "Source and destination overlap"
			
	create_image_xml
		- add more output to create_image_xml
		
	pngcmp:
		- how to speed up writing of diff?
		- try to optimize it, but comparing and writing in the same loop and just don't write the final bitmap when they differ
		- package optimized mingw binary instead of Visual Studio one

	Known Issues:
		- not everything is properly encoded by xmlEncodeEntitiesReentrant()
		- using autosave will overwrite the initial valgrind log-file for the driver (well..not really, it adds the pid - still you want to differ them easily)

	Misc:
		- create patch to write ui_popup() to -log output
		- MAME patches
			- add "exit"/"run-and-hide" command to debugger
